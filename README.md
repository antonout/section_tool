# Section Tool for stress analysis

A tiny simple program dedicated to aid stress analysts to calculate the geometrical properties of a number of cross-section shapes. 

The following shapes are implemented:
- rectangle;
- circle;
- ring;
- i-beam.

The program outputs the following properties:
- area;
- area moment of inertia relative to the major (I_xx) and minor (I_yy) axis;
- section modulus (at extreme fiber) relative to the major (Z_xx) and minor (Z_yy) axis.
